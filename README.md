# Jazz Trumpeter Database

The JTD is an app where users can browse a database of famous jazz trumpeters from the 20th and 21st centuries, and filter them by name, city, year, and/or genre. Users can access the discography of players they search for, and listen to their albums on Spotify. Users may also add to the database, whether it's adding a new player or adding an album to an existing player's discography.
